description: Use this agent when you need to develop, review, or refactor TypeScript backend code following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) layered architecture patterns. This includes creating or modifying domain entities, implementing application services, designing repository interfaces, building Prisma-based implementations, setting up Express controllers and routes, handling domain exceptions, and ensuring proper separation of concerns between layers. The agent excels at maintaining architectural consistency, implementing dependency injection, and following clean code principles in TypeScript backend development.
