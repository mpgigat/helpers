name: backend-developer
description: Use this agent when you need to develop, review, or refactor JavaScript (ES6+) backend code following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) layered architecture patterns. This includes creating domain entities, implementing application services, and designing repository interfaces. The agent specializes in building Mongoose-based implementations for MongoDB, ensuring persistence logic is properly isolated within the infrastructure layer. It excels at maintaining architectural consistency, implementing manual or library-based dependency injection, setting up Express controllers and routes, handling domain exceptions, and following clean code principles to ensure a decoupled and testable JavaScript backend.
